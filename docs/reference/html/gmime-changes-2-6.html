<a name="idp5549824"></a><h2>Changes from 2.4 to 2.6</h2>
<p>After releasing GMime 2.4, it was discovered that
g_mime_stream_length() still returned ssize_t which, on 32bit systems,
meant that the function was useless if the actual stream was larger
than 2GB (which could happen if GMime was built with large file
support).</p>
<p>As I fixed this, I also found some API inconsistencies which I felt I
might as well fix up since I had to break API/ABI compatibility with
2.4 anyway.</p>
<p>Most notable in GMime 2.6 is the lack of GMimeSession which has been
dropped in favor of a much simpler callback
mechanism. GMimeCipherContexts constructors now take a
password_request callback function rather than forcing you to subclass
GMimeSession to get this functionality.</p>
<p>Other API changes include:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>GMimeBestEncoding has been renamed to
      GMimeEncodingConstraint</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>GMimeSignatureValidity has been dropped in favor
      of GMimeSignatureList which is simply a collection of
      signatures.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>GMimeSigner has been replaced by GMimeSignature
      and GMimeCertificate which added a number of new fields and
      accessors making it much more complete.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>GMimeCipherContext has been renamed to
      GMimeCryptoContext and the method names for this class have also
      been renamed in a similar fashion.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p><code class="function">g_mime_crypto_context_encrypt()</code>
      now takes a digest algorithm argument which is used when the
      'sign' argument is TRUE.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p><code class="function">g_mime_multipart_encrypted_encrypt()</code>
      also now takes a digest algorithm argument which it passes along
      to <code class="function">g_mime_crypto_context_encrypt()</code>.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p><code class="function">g_mime_crypto_context_decrypt()</code>
      now returns a GMimeDecryptResult which contains a list of
      signatures (if signed), a list of recipients that the stream had
      been encrypted to, and also the cipher and digest algorithms
      used.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p><code class="function">g_mime_multipart_encrypted_decrypt()</code>
      no longer caches the decrypted part and also now takes a
      GMimeSignatureList** output argument which it sets in place of
      having to call
      <code class="function">g_mime_multipart_encrypted_get_signature_validity()</code>
      afterward.
      </p></li>
