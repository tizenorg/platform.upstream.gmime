<a name="idp5480720"></a><h2>Changes from 2.2 to 2.4</h2>
<p>GMime 2.4 has had a number of API changes since GMime
2.2. To start, ALL public APIs that used to use off_t in GMime 2.2 now
use gint64 so that the API and ABI do not change based on whether or
not large file support is enabled.</p>
<p>In addition, all of the functions marked as deprecated in
2.0 and 2.2 were removed (usually they had equivalent functionality in
a parent class).</p>
<p>Many functions have also been renamed for better clarity
and/or consistency. For convenience, GMime 2.4 source packages include
a shell-script to aid in porting applications using GMime 2.2 (should
work for most GMime 2.0 applications as well) to the 2.4 API. You can
find this script under the tools/ directory, named
`gmime-port-2-2-to-2-4.sh'.</p>
<p>This script won't fix everything, but it should help quite a
bit.</p>
<p>Beyond that, a few methods have changed in other ways:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p><code class="function">g_mime_cipher_context_sign()</code>
  still returns int, but if the value isn't -1 (failure), then it will
  represent a GMimeCipherHash that it used for signing. This is
  useful, for example, when the requested hash was
  GMIME_CIPHER_HASH_DEFAULT.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p><code class="function">g_mime_cipher_context_decrypt()</code>
  now returns a GMimeSignatureValidty on success and NULL on
  failure. This is needed in case the encrypted stream was also
  signed.</p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p><code class="function">g_mime_multipart_encrypted_encrypt()</code>
  now takes a boolean 'sign' argument to allow the caller to request
  encrypting and signing in a single pass.</p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>Several structs have also been rewritten to subclass GObject like
GMimeContentType and GMimeContentDisposition as well as
InternetAddress and InternetAddressList.</p>
<p>Not only have InternetAddress and InternetAddressList been ported to
GObject, but they have also undergone other design
changes. InternetAddress is now a base class for
InternetAddressMailbox and InternetAddressGroup, meaning that
InternetAddress no longer contains a union for group/addr fields.</p>
<p>All functions that return a GObject have been changed to not add a ref
to the object returned, meaning that it is no longer necessary to call
g_object_unref() on MIME parts returned from functions like
g_mime_message_get_mime_part() or g_mime_multipart_get_part(). This
was done to be more consistent with the Gtk+ API.</p>
